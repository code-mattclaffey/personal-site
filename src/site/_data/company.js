My focus was to build a design system which would be more reusable, accessible and well written tests. I also setup a lot of Ci integrations such as percy.io (visual regression testing) and unit testing. Other than that I work on BAU work for clients day to day making sure that the code that is written follows the criteria of the ticket assigned to me.</p>

We also follow a scrum way of working but also has Kanban in other teams.</p>

                <p>My role was to collaborate with the Designers & Backend Developers in making the high- quality products for the client.</p>

                <p>While making sure the frontend code was to the highest standard, I also learnt about working in an agile way by using Kanban boards to track client work. We followed a principle of releasing in small chunks rather than one big release. We also took part in team retroâ€™s & estimated tickets in terms of complexity.</p>

                <p>I also participated in upskilling other members of the team. I worked with a graduate frontend developer upskilling him to become a professional frontend developer. We did a lot of pairing together on tasks and I also split out time to work on side projects.
                I love sharing new technology or new ideas that could change the way we currently did things. These types of talks varied between team learning sessions & developer meetings.
                Other tasks I was involved in was being sent out to other clients offices to consult around performance. </p>
